# Metro

### What

Utilities to work with Yandex Metro API data

### Why

With current Yandex Metro you can't easily find all stations that meet certain travel budgets relative to your destination station.

E.g. you work near "Sokolniki" and want to find all stations that are within 10 minutes and 1 transfer maximum enroute. This utility does just that

### How

See [Main](https://github.com/ousenko/metro/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/agency/v3/metro/Main.kt) method for working example
